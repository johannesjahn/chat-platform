// WebSocket, authenticates it with a single-use ticket redeemed via
// WsTicket (minted over REST — see RealtimeHandler.ts — with the same
// access token used for other calls), and registers the connection so chat
// and post mutations can push `chat_updated`/`post_changed` events — to
// exactly the affected chat's participants, or to every connected user for
// posts (see Realtime.ts). Added directly to `HttpApiBuilder.Router` — the
// same shared router `ChatApi`'s endpoints are attached to — so it's served
// alongside them by the one Bun server.
//
// `router.get` requires its handler's requirements to already be resolved
// down to what the router provides on every request (`HttpServerRequest`,
// `Scope`, …) — it can't itself carry extra services like `WsTicket` or
// `RealtimeConnections` through to the caller. So, the same way
// `HttpApiBuilder.group` wires up endpoint handlers, this captures the
// ambient context (which does include `WsTicket`/`RealtimeConnections`,
// supplied by whoever builds this layer — see main.ts) and merges it back
// into the handler via `mapInputContext`, turning "needs WsTicket |
// RealtimeConnections" into "needs nothing more", while still leaving those
// two as this Layer's own unresolved requirements for main.ts to provide.
